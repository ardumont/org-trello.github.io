Once the [installation](/install.html) and
the [setup](/trello-setup.html) are done!

A typical starting point would be to synchronize the trello board to
the current buffer.

Hit <kbd>C-u C-c o s</kbd>.

This will trigger the <kbd>C-u M-x org-trello-sync-buffer</kbd> which
is in charge of fetching the current board's data and writing it
inside the current buffer.

From this on, you can use your org buffer as usual.

When you want to update the trello board from the org buffer:

- <kbd>C-c o c</kbd>/<kbd>C-c o C</kbd> to update the card.

- <kbd>C-c o s</kbd> If you want to push all your org buffer's
  content. This will sync to trello all the entities from your buffer.

When you want to update the org buffer from trello:

- <kbd>C-u C-c o c</kbd> / <kbd>C-u C-c o C</kbd> to update the card
  from trello

For more details, see the [usage](/usage.html) section.
